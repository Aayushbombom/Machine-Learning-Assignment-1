# Machine-Learning-Assignment-1

## Aim: To Predict whether a patient is diabetic or not.

## Preprocessing:
#### The database contains synthetic data which is generated from the given orginal dataset.
#### Null values are filled using linear interpolation
#### The cleaned scaled using a minmax scaler before passing it to the various algorithms.

## Algorithms Used: 
 #### 1. Linear Regression using Batch and Stocastic Gradient Descent
 #### 2. Polynomial Regression using Regularization
 #### 3. Logistic Regression
 #### 4. Least Square Classification
